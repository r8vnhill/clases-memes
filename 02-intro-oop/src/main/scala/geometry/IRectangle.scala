/**
 * Represents the idea (or contract) of a Rectangle.
 *
 * A trait in Scala is like an interface in other languages: it defines the <b>methods</b> that any
 * class claiming to be a Rectangle must provide.
 *
 * Important:
 *   - A trait does not give an implementation here. It only says "any Rectangle must be able to do
 *     these things."
 *   - Later, classes that implement this trait will be responsible for providing the concrete code
 *     for each method.
 *
 * Key concepts illustrated:
 *   - **Abstraction**: We describe *what* a Rectangle can do (move and compute area), not *how* it
 *     does it.
 *   - **Encapsulation of behavior**: By depending on the trait instead of a specific class, we gain
 *     flexibility in OOP.

   *
   * @param x
   *   how much to move along the x-axis
   * @param y
   *   how much to move along the y-axis
