 * ⚠️ Note for students:
 *
 * In professional projects, test classes are usually <b>not documented</b> because:
 *   - Their purpose should be obvious from their names (e.g., `CalculatorTest` tests `Calculator`).
 *   - The test methods themselves are expected to be self-explanatory if well written.
 *
 * Here we include documentation and comments explicitly because this is for **learning purposes**.
 * The goal is to help you understand both *how tests are structured* and *why we write them*.
